#While loops 
"""Comparing for loops vs while loops. 

for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something to each item 

for number in range(a,b):
    print(number)

Two flavors of loops, one where we're looping through a list of items to do something to each item in the list and the other 
is using a range function where we create a range and we use every number in that range to do something 

while something_is_true:
    #Do something repeatedly 

The while loop basically means while the particular condition is true, do something till it is false 

When should you use a for loop vs a while loop. 
Loops are great for when you want to iterate over something and you need to do something to each thing you're
iterating over 

While loops are good for when you don't care what number of sequence you're in and want it to lop till the condition you set 
becomes True
