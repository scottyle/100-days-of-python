Environment variables 
2 reasons why you would use one 

1. Lets say you build a large application instead of changing the code base and updating the code you could have environmental variables you update.
For example applications sending an email, certain variables in your code could be used as base variables 

2. Security if you're uploading your code online, its not good to upload authentication keys or API keys as the rest of your code. 

Environment variables allow us to separate out where we store our keys, secret stuff and other various variables away from where our code base is located.
