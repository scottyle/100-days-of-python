What is CSS? 
Cascading style sheets 

How do you add CSS to plain HTML websites? 
Three ways of adding CSS into HTML website 

Inline 
Ex.
<html style="background:blue"> </html>
(style attribute that is global avaiable to all tags not just HTML)
- Inline elements are useful for adding CSS style to just a single element 
- Not recommended to use inline styles in your entire doc, used for when you're testing or you want to use it in one single element 

Internal
Ex.
<html> 
    <head> 
        <style> 
            html (Selector){
                background: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>
- internal CSS is added using a special element called the "style element"
- this applies the internal style to anywhere within the same HTML document 
- if you have a multi-page website you probably shouldnt be using the internal style you should use the external CSS style 
- biggest difference between internal/external css is that the external styles live in another file, usually styles.css or main.css

External 
Ex.
Index.html 
<html> 
    <head> 
        <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href=".styles.css"
        />
    </head>
</html> 

styles.css
html{
    background:green; 
}
- most commonly used in web development 

CSS selectors 
- Where to apply our CSS 
- we can create CSS rules by specifying two thigns 
    - the property we want to change and a colon we specify the value to change that property to
        ex: 
        h1(CSS selector) {
            color(property): blue(value)
        }
    - What is a CSS selector, its the part that selects the HTML to apply whichever ruels go in between the curly braces 
    - Element selector - the selector is above it targets all the h1's (a selector that targets a specific element)
    - Class selector 
        ex:
        .red-text(name of the class) {
            color:red
        }
        - What is a class?
            - A class is something we can add as a attribute to any HTML element for example 
                <h2 class ="red-text">Red</h2> 
                <p class="red-text">Paragraph</p> 
    - ID selector 
        ex:
        #main{
            color:red
        }        
        - this selects all elemets with a particular ID attribute 
        - this is what it looks like 
        <h2 id="main">Red</h2>
    - Difference between ID and Class selector
        - Class selector can be applied to many elements 
        - ID selector should be applied to one element in a single HTML file 
    - Attribute selector 
        ex:
        p[draggable]{
            color:red
        }
        - what does this do? select all p elements with the attribute draggable and apply this CSS style 
    - Universal selector
        ex:
        *(select all){
            color:red
        }
        - this is a select all selector where it applies to everything
