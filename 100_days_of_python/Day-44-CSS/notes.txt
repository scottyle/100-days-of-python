CSS

What is CSS? 
Cascading style sheets 

How do you add CSS to plain HTML websites? 
Three ways of adding CSS into HTML website 

Inline 
Ex.
<html style="background:blue"> </html>
(style attribute that is global avaiable to all tags not just HTML)
- Inline elements are useful for adding CSS style to just a single element 
- Not recommended to use inline styles in your entire doc, used for when you're testing or you want to use it in one single element 

Internal
Ex.
<html> 
    <head> 
        <style> 
            html (Selector){
                background: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
</html>
- internal CSS is added using a special element called the "style element"
- this applies the internal style to anywhere within the same HTML document 
- if you have a multi-page website you probably shouldnt be using the internal style you should use the external CSS style 
- biggest difference between internal/external css is that the external styles live in another file, usually styles.css or main.css

External 
Ex.
Index.html 
<html> 
    <head> 
        <link
            rel="stylesheet"
            href=".styles.css"
        />
    </head>
</html> 

styles.css
html{
    background:green; 
}
- most commonly used in web development 

CSS selectors 
- Where to apply our CSS 
- we can create CSS rules by specifying two thigns 
    - the property we want to change and a colon we specify the value to change that property to
        ex: 
        h1(CSS selector) {
            color(property): blue(value)
        }
    - What is a CSS selector, its the part that selects the HTML to apply whichever ruels go in between the curly braces 
    - Element selector - the selector is above it targets all the h1's (a selector that targets a specific element)
    - Class selector 
        ex:
        .red-text(name of the class) {
            color:red
        }
        - What is a class?
            - A class is something we can add as a attribute to any HTML element for example 
                <h2 class ="red-text">Red</h2> 
                <p class="red-text">Paragraph</p> 
    - ID selector 
        ex:
        #main{
            color:red
        }        
        - this selects all elemets with a particular ID attribute 
        - this is what it looks like 
        <h2 id="main">Red</h2>
    - Difference between ID and Class selector
        - Class selector can be applied to many elements 
        - ID selector should be applied to one element in a single HTML file 
    - Attribute selector 
        ex:
        p[draggable]{
            color:red
        }
        - what does this do? select all p elements with the attribute draggable and apply this CSS style 
    - Universal selector
        ex:
        *(select all){
            color:red
        }
        - this is a select all selector where it applies to everything 

Color properties 
- How do we know that we can use certain colors? 
    - These are named named colors and we can go through the MDN docs to find the named color 
- colorhunt.co (Color plaettes)
    - To use these type of colors you have to use hex codes 

Font Properties 
- Font sizes uses pixels to represent the font size we can also use a pt
    - ex: 20px 
    - ex: 20pt 
- When developing websites use the rem to set the font size (1rem = 100% of the root, 1em = 100% of the parent)

h1 {
    color: blue
    font-weight: 
    font-size: 20px 
}

- Font Weight you can have either normal or bold 
h1 {
    font-weight: bold
}

- Font Family - determines what you want your text to look like the comman behind the Helvetica is a backup font for the user if they do not have that font type on their computer 
h1{
    font-family:Helvetica,sans-serif
}

h1 {
    font-family: "Times New Roman",serif
}

The Box Model
-Margin,Padding and Border 
- Border property border: 10px solid black 
    - First value is the thickness of the border around the HTML element, seconnd item is the style of the border, finally color of the border (any name color or hex color)
- Once you define a border you can further modify it with more specific rules 
border: 10px solid black 
    border-top: 0px; (this means that the top of the border will be 0px)

- Padding simply adds the padding or space between the element and the border 
padding: 20px 

- margin, the outside part of the border (any other content aka elements)
margin: 10px 

Content division element 
- lets say we want to style two bits together we can wrap a box around the two elements this is known as Content Division Element 
- It is a generic container used to group other HTML elements together 
Ex: 
<div class="card">
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>This is some content.</p>
</div>
- above the h2 and paragraph can be styled together
